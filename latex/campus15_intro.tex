\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Our aim to design and develop a cyber-physical system to improve the safety of people with hearing impairment.  We envision that such a CPS system can easily become an integral part of a smart campus or smart city, and can provide assistance to people without serious hearing problems.

In this proposal, we will focus on the following research challenges:
\begin{itemizer}
\item \emph{Detecting and localizing important sounds.} First, our system can help the subjects detect important sounds, such as car approaching, and more importantly, can localize the source of the sound. In this way, we make sure there is sufficient time to navigate the subject away from the danger. 
    
\item \emph{Extract contexts around the subjects.}
\item \emph{Privacy protection.}
\end{itemizer}
